ðŸ“š Deep Learning Internship Projects â€“ Prodigy InfoTech

Welcome to the repository containing my internship projects at Prodigy InfoTech, where I worked on various deep learning tasks involving text and image generation. This collection of projects demonstrates practical applications of generative models, statistical models, and computer vision techniques.

âœ… Projects Overview
1. Text Generation with GPT-2

Fine-tuned OpenAIâ€™s GPT-2 model on a custom dataset.

Generated coherent and contextually relevant text based on given prompts.

Explored transformer architecture and language modeling.

2. Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

Used models like DALL-E mini and Stable Diffusion to generate images from text prompts.

Implemented image creation pipelines using Hugging Faceâ€™s libraries.

Learned how to handle pretrained models and integrate them into practical workflows.

3. Text Generation with Markov Chains

Implemented a simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains.

Built a statistical model to predict words based on previous occurrences.

Gained insights into probabilistic modeling and sequence generation.

4. Image-to-Image Translation with cGAN

Built an Image-to-Image Translation model using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN).

Trained on paired datasets of aerial and map images.

Implemented convolutional neural networks for image translation.

Faced challenges with dataset preparation and training stability.

Achieved partial results with potential for further optimization.
